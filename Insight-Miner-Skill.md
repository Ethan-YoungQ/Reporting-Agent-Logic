# Business Analysis Examples

This document provides concrete examples of applying the seven-dimension framework to different business scenarios.

## Example 1: SaaS Company Quarterly Revenue Analysis

### Outcome
Q3 2024 ARR reached $48.2M, achieving 96% of $50M target, representing a shortfall of $1.8M. This represents 22% YoY growth from $39.5M in Q3 2023, but growth has decelerated from 28% in Q2 2024. MRR growth slowed to 1.8% QoQ vs. 2.5% target.

### Variance
Segment breakdown of the $1.8M shortfall:
- Enterprise (>$100K contracts): +$0.8M vs. target (108% achievement) - exceeded by 8 new logos
- Mid-Market ($25K-$100K): -$0.3M vs. target (94% achievement) - 12 fewer customers than planned
- SMB (<$25K): -$2.3M vs. target (77% achievement) - high churn offset new customer adds

Geographic variance:
- North America: On target at $28.5M
- Europe: +$0.4M vs. target
- APAC: -$2.2M vs. target (primarily due to SMB segment weakness)

### Driver
Enterprise outperformance driven by:
1. New industry vertical expansion (healthcare) - 5 of 8 net-new logos, averaging $145K ACV
2. Product feature releases (API v3, SSO) closing 18% more enterprise deals in pipeline
3. Strategic account team restructure yielding 35% higher win rate (48% vs. 35% in Q2)

SMB underperformance caused by:
1. Churn rate elevated at 4.8% vs. 3.2% historical - primary driver is credit card failure rate increase from 12% to 19% (payment processor migration issue)
2. Acquisition cost increased 42% ($480 to $680) due to Google Ads CPC inflation in target keywords
3. Competitor "SmartSaaS" aggressive pricing undercut our entry tier by 30%

APAC weakness caused by:
1. Delayed localization (language support) pushed from Q2 to Q4
2. Macro headwinds in key markets (Australia recession, Japan tech spending freeze)

### Strategy Validation
Strategic Initiative Assessment:

**1. Enterprise Vertical Expansion (Healthcare)**
- Target: 5 healthcare logos by Q3, $500K ARR
- Actual: 5 logos, $725K ARR (145% of target)
- VERDICT: ✓ Strong success. Continue and expand to financial services in Q4.

**2. SMB Self-Service Growth**
- Target: 200 net-new SMB customers, $1.5M ARR contribution
- Actual: 85 net-new (57% vs. target), $0.6M ARR (40% of target)
- VERDICT: ✗ Significantly underperforming. Payment processor issue and competitive pricing pressure major factors. Requires strategic review.

**3. APAC Market Expansion**
- Target: $8M ARR by Q3
- Actual: $5.8M ARR (73% of target)
- VERDICT: ✗ Behind plan. Localization delays and macro factors. Consider slowing investment until market conditions improve and product readiness achieved.

### Leading Indicator
Q4 2024 Pipeline Signals:

**Sales Pipeline:**
- Total pipeline: $72M (2.4x Q4 target of $30M)
- Enterprise: $45M (healthy at 3.0x coverage)
- Mid-Market: $18M (2.25x coverage, below ideal 3x)
- SMB: $9M (1.5x coverage, concerning given high churn)
- Weighted pipeline (by stage probabilities): $28.5M (95% of Q4 target)

**Product Usage Trends:**
- DAU/MAU ratio improved from 0.42 to 0.47 (higher stickiness)
- Feature adoption of new API increasing 15% week-over-week
- However, SMB cohort trial-to-paid conversion dropped to 18% vs. 25% historical

**Market Indicators:**
- Gartner positioned us in "Leaders" quadrant (first time), expect 20-30% inbound lift
- G2 score improved 4.3 to 4.6 stars
- Website traffic up 28% MoM, but SMB segment traffic conversion down to 2.1% from 3.2%

**Concerns:**
- Sales cycle length extended from 65 to 78 days (enterprise), may push 15% of Q4 pipeline to Q1 2025
- SMB payment failure not yet resolved, will continue to impact Q4

### Risk
**HIGH PRIORITY RISKS:**

1. **Payment Processor Issue (SMB Churn)**
   - Probability: 80% continues into Q4 without intervention
   - Impact: Additional $800K ARR churn in Q4 (320 customers at 4.8% monthly churn vs. 3.2% baseline)
   - Current Status: Engineering fix scheduled for Nov 15, but testing may delay to Dec 1
   - Mitigation: Expedite engineering timeline, manual outreach to failed payment customers

### HQ Ask

**IMMEDIATE DECISION REQUIRED (72 hours):**

1. **SMB Payment Recovery Investment**
   - Ask: Approve emergency $150K budget for engineering overtime and manual customer recovery
   - Rationale: Every week of delay costs $200K ARR (80 customers churning). Fix solves 50% of SMB churn issue
   - Expected Impact: Reduce churn from 4.8% to 3.5%, save $600K ARR in Q4 and $2.4M annually
   - ROI: 16:1 first year ($2.4M saved vs. $150K investment)
   - Recommendation: APPROVE immediately

**STRATEGIC DECISIONS (2-week timeline):**

2. **SMB Segment Strategy: Defend vs. Retreat**
   - Decision Needed: Maintain current SMB focus or shift resources to mid-market/enterprise?
   - Context: SMB underperforming at 77% of target, facing structural headwinds (pricing pressure, churn, high CAC)
   - Option A - Defend: Invest additional $400K in competitive pricing/marketing to protect segment
     - Pros: Maintain $15M ARR base, preserve land-and-expand motion
     - Cons: Uncertain ROI given competitive dynamics, diverts resources from stronger segments
   - Option B - Strategic Retreat: Gradual shift to mid-market, maintain existing SMB base without new acquisition focus
     - Pros: Reallocate resources to 94%+ performing segments, improve unit economics
     - Cons: Concede market to competitor, reduce future expansion pool
   - Recommendation: Prefer Option B, but need exec alignment on 3-year strategy

3. **APAC Investment Pace**
   - Ask: Reduce APAC investment by 40% until localization complete and market conditions stabilize
   - Rationale: Currently 73% of plan, macro headwinds, product not ready. Inefficient capital deployment
   - Savings: $600K in Q4 operating expenses
